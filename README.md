Hi, I’m Olerato!👋🏾 

I have a passion for all things software, with a focus on using technology to solve real-life problems. I am currently exploring blockchain and smart contract development on the Internet Computer, as well as delving into the exciting worlds of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

I'm looking to collaborate on one of my projects, called Kuro, a powerful command engine (link below).

If you'd like to connect, you can reach me at @ortmasiu on Twitter!
