Hi, I'm Olerato!üëãüèæ

I'm a passionate mechanical engineering student with a strong focus on leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to solve real-life problems. I'm fascinated by the potential of these technologies to drive innovation and create impactful solutions.

Currently, I am actively exploring the exciting fields of machine learning, deep learning, and AI development. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in these areas to contribute to cutting-edge advancements.

I'm eager to collaborate on one of my projects that showcases the capabilities of AI and machine learning. It's called Kuro, a powerful command engine designed to revolutionize user interactions. You can find more information about Kuro at the following link: [www.github.com/ortmasiu/kurocommandengine](www.github.com/ortmasiu/kurocommandengine).

If you share my enthusiasm for AI and machine learning and would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter. You can find me at [@ortmasiu](https://twitter.com/ortmasiu).

I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and make a positive impact in the field of AI and machine learning.

Best regards,
Olerato
