Hi, I'm Olerato!👋🏾

I'm a passionate mechanical engineering student with a strong interest in software development and using technology to tackle real-life challenges. Currently, I am exploring the fascinating realms of blockchain and smart contract development on the Internet Computer. Additionally, I'm delving into the exciting fields of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

I'm actively seeking collaboration for one of my projects called Kuro, a robust command engine. You can find more information about Kuro at the following link: [www.github.com/ortmasiu/kurocommandengine](www.github.com/ortmasiu/kurocommandengine).

If you're interested in connecting and potentially collaborating, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter. You can find me at [@ortmasiu](https://twitter.com/ortmasiu).

Looking forward to connecting!

Best regards,
Olerato
