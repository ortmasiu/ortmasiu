Hi, I’m Olerato!
👀 I have a passion for all things software, with a focus on using technology to solve real-life problems.
🌱 I am currently exploring blockchain and smart contract development on the Internet Computer, as well as delving into the exciting worlds of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.
💞️ I am looking to collaborate on one of my projects, called Kuro, a powerful command engine (link below).
📫 If you'd like to connect, you can reach me at @ortmasiu on Twitter!
